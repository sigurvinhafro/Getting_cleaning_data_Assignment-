The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This project includes six files: README.md, Codebook.md, Download_files.R, run_analysis.R, TidyData.txt, Rproject

Followings are done:

Download the dataset to my working directory and unzip.

Load the dataset: X_train.txt, X_test.txt, Y_train.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, features.txt, activity_labels.txt.

Merges the X_train and X_test.txt.

Merges the Y_train and Y_test.txt.

Merges the subject_train and subject_test.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
